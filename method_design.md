As a user
So that I can keep track of my tasks
I want to check if a text includes the string #TODO.

> ## 2. Design the Method Signature
<!-- to_do(text)
text = string
return = boolean -->

> ## 3. Create Examples as Tests
<!-- to_do? ("#TODO") = true
to_do? ("todo") = false
to_do? ("TODO") = false -->


> ## 4. Implement the Behaviour
> 
> For each example you create as a test, implement the behaviour that allows the
> method to return the right value for the given arguments.
> 
> Then return to step 3 until you have addressed the problem you were given. You
> may also need to revise your design, for example if you realise you made a
> mistake earlier.
